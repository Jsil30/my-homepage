Simple homepage with a purple → orange → blue gradient background.

How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (macOS):

```bash
open /Users/jani.silva/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Slalom/Documents/Protogen/my-homepage/index.html
```

2. Replace the placeholder image with your own photo:
   - Place your photo at `images/me.jpg` (or change the `src` in `index.html`).
   - For best results use a square image or a larger photo; the CSS will crop it to a circle.

Notes

- The "Contact me" button currently does nothing (it's a non-functional demo button).
- The page uses a small placeholder SVG at `images/placeholder.svg` which will show automatically if `images/me.jpg` isn't found.
